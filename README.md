# deal-scraper
Spoofee.com deal scraper app that uses cheerio to scrape a news site, mongodb to save newdeals and comments, and express to serve the site and data.

I've managed to tweak this a bit so it doesn't look horrible and the main functionality works as expected.

More could be done to inform the user, and it could be a bit flashier, but it's clean and it works all right for an MVP.
